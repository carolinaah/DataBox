# Petition to increase public investment on mental health prevention strategies for adolescents in Mexico 

## Outline

### Project summary
  The Mexican Ministry of  Public Health allocated in 2017 to the mental health system only 2% of its total budget, eight percent below of what the World Health Organization recommends countries to invest in mental health. Around 80% of the budget designated to mental health is spent in the maintance of psychiatric hospitals and the rest is distribute between detection, prevention and rehabilitation strategies.  

  The purpose of this project is to convince the audience to sign a petition addressed to the Ministry of Public Health and the Ministry of Finance to increase public funding in mental health detection, prevention and rehabilitation strategies for Mexican adolescents. The project will provide the reader with statistics about the prevalence and severity of mental disorders among Mexican adolescents and the current level of service use and provision, with the objective to raise awareness about the state of mental health of Mexican adolescents. After providing such information, the project will include figures related to mental health detection, prevention and rehabilitation spending. Finally, the project will direct the audience to sign the petition.

### Challenges
  The project is directed to the Mexican population with access to internet service. Because of this, one of the main challenges of the project will be to finish both the English and Spanish versions on time. 

## Method 
The project will use a storytelling method. 
is building a story using your data using Shorthand - but this is my no means your only option.  You may select another digital platform (e.g. Esri's Story Maps, etc.), or you may propose doing something else entirely (AR / VR, mixed media

## The Data 

### The National Household Survey (ENH)
  Although mental disorders begin to pose a public health problem in Mexico, there is very little information on the mental health status of adolescents in the country. The National Census Bureau (INEGI), together with the Ministry of Public Health, collects information on the mental health of the population at the household level through the National Household Survey (ENH), which includes questions about the condition of depressive and anxiety disorders in the population. However, the mental health component of the ENH is limited to six questions from which it is only possible to estimate the frequency and intensity of the ailments. 
  
### The Mexican Adolescent Mental Health Survey (MAMHS)
       As an effort to fill the information gap about mental health, in 2005, the Mexican Adolescent Mental Health Survey (MAMHS) was conducted by the National Institute of Psychiatry "Juan Ramón de la Fuente" in collaboration with the Ministry of Public Health and the WHO. The MAMHS was constructed from the diagnostic standards included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association. The survey was designed to be representative of 1,834,661 adolescents aged 12 to 17 living in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area. The results of MAMHS are not available to the general public. However, the Ministry of Public Health through the National Institute of Psychiatry ¨Juan Ramón de la Fuente¨ has made available a series of published studies where the information obtained is presented and analyzed. Data for this project will be takes from these studies, which are cited below:
