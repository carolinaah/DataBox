# Petition to increase public investment on mental health prevention strategies for adolescents in Mexico 
# PART I 
## Outline 

### Project summary
  The Mexican Ministry of  Public Health allocated in 2017 to the mental health system only 2% of its total budget, eight percent below of what the World Health Organization recommends countries to invest in mental health. Around 80% of the budget designated to mental health is spent in the maintance of psychiatric hospitals and the rest is distribute between detection, prevention and rehabilitation strategies.  

  The purpose of this project is to convince the audience to sign a petition addressed to the Ministry of Public Health and the Ministry of Finance to increase public funding in mental health detection, prevention and rehabilitation strategies for Mexican adolescents. The project will provide the reader with statistics about the prevalence and severity of mental disorders among Mexican adolescents and the current level of service use and provision, with the objective to raise awareness about the state of mental health of Mexican adolescents. After providing such information, the project will include figures related to mental health detection, prevention and rehabilitation spending. Finally, the project will direct the audience to sign the petition. 

### Project structure 

1. The state of mental health of adolescents in Mexico 
2. Causes  
3. Consequences 
4. Current public investment and budget distribution 
5. Petition  

### Measuring success 

1. Number of site visits
2. Number of signatures

### Challenges
  The project is directed to the Mexican population with access to internet service. Because of this, one of the main challenges of the project will be to finish both the English and Spanish versions on time. 

## Method 
The project will use a storytelling method. The story will have the objective of educating and emotionally engaging the reader. I will build the story using Shorthand and Scene VR. The data visualizations will be created in R Shiny, images will come from websites with images released under Creative Commons License such as pixabay or flickr and will depict emotional images of adolescents in Mexico. Below is a very simple mockup of what the site will look like.

## The Data 
Because data on violence, poverty and mental health is scattered across different sources, this project will use different databases listed below. 
### The National Household Survey (ENH)
  Although mental disorders begin to pose a public health problem in Mexico, there is very little information on the mental health status of adolescents in the country. The National Census Bureau (INEGI), together with the Ministry of Public Health, collects information on the mental health of the population at the household level through the National Household Survey (ENH), which includes questions about the condition of depressive and anxiety disorders in the population. However, the mental health component of the ENH is limited to six questions from which it is only possible to estimate the frequency and intensity of the ailments.

### Health Statistics in Private Establishments 2009-2016 

Health Statistics provide information on the provision of health services, the availability of human, physical and material resources of medical units as well as hospital morbidity recorded through the main diagnosis of exit from the private sector. This information is used for analysis, research, planning and evaluation of the characteristics and effects of health policy in the country.

### Mortality Statistics
The Mortality Statistics collects data on general and fetal deaths, including deaths related to suicide, to characterize the phenomenon of mortality in the country. The information is collected by The National Census Bureau (INEGI) and the Ministry of Public Health

### Social Cohesion Survey for the Prevention of Violence and Crime (ECOPRED) 2014
This survey seeks to generate estimates of some of the factors conducive to the emergence of criminal and violent behaviour. It also seeks to obtain information on the advantages and vulnerabilities that affect the development of young people between 12 and 29 years of age, heads of household, as well as communities and / or neighborhoods.

### The Mexican Adolescent Mental Health Survey (MAMHS)
  As an effort to fill the information gap about mental health, in 2005, the Mexican Adolescent Mental Health Survey (MAMHS) was conducted by the National Institute of Psychiatry "Juan Ramón de la Fuente" in collaboration with the Ministry of Public Health and the WHO. The MAMHS was constructed from the diagnostic standards included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association. The survey was designed to be representative of 1,834,661 adolescents aged 12 to 17 living in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area. The results of MAMHS are not available to the general public. However, the Ministry of Public Health through the National Institute of Psychiatry ¨Juan Ramón de la Fuente¨ has made available a series of published studies where the information obtained is presented and analyzed. Data for this project will be takes from these studies, which are cited below:

# PART II  
## Storyboard

The purpose of this sections is to provide a visual walk-through of the different components of the story. As described in Part I of this project, the storyline will follow the following structure: 

1. The state of mental health of adolescents in Mexico 
2. Causes  
3. Consequences 
4. Current public investment and budget distribution 
5. Petition  

Below is a visual storyboard that outlines the steps I plan to create and how I would like the reader to understand and make sense of the information given. The goal of the project is for the reader to gain a general understanding of the importance of youth mental health in Mexico, to understand its causes and consequences, and to have a sense of how little the federal government and the Ministry of Public Health are investing in prevention strategies. The main strategies used in the storyboard below to engage the reader and convince them to sign the petition to increase the funding are:

1. Provide the reader with relevant and eye-catching statistics so that they can form their own opinion on the subject and generate a feeling of sympathy. 
2. Use little text and emphasize important figures with different font sizes. 
3. Accompany graphics with text that helps the reader better understand the information. 
4. Make the reader feel empowered and capable of making a change.
