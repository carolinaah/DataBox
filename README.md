# Carolina's Graphics Box
Hello! welcome to my repo of data visualizations. For the next couple of weeks, this will be what I called my "graphics box" for my Telling Stories with data class at CMU. 

## About me 
I am a second-year student of the Masters program in Public Policy and Management at Carnegie Mellon University. I am from Mexico City and currently living with my husband in Pittsburgh, PA. I am interested in education policy and leadership, with a special focus on mental health programs in schools. 

## What I hope to learn in this class...
I hope to learn new ways of visualizing data, aside from the basic designs such as bar graphs, pie charts, line and scatter plots. My hope is to improve my creativity and my communication skills.

## Portfolio
Over here you will find the visualizations I will be creating throughout the course.
